    <h1>User Management</h1>
    <div class=3D"Section1">
        <p>The users page under the administrator section gives you a view =
of what users exist in RAS. On this page, you can see all users, their emai=
l addresses, the company they're associated with, their permissions, and mo=
re.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id=3D"UserManagement-List">List</h1>
<p>Per user, the following information is shown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Id<br></strong>The user's database ID. Not often used.&nbsp;</l=
i>
<li><strong>Company<br></strong>The company with which the user is associat=
ed</li>
<li><strong>Email<br></strong>The email address for the user.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Email Confirmed<br></strong>Whether or not the user has confirm=
ed his email address. If not, the user will not be able to log in</li>
<li><strong>Locked out</strong><br>Whether or not the user is locked out. I=
f true, the user will not be able to log in.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Permissions<br></strong>A list of what we allow this user to do=
. If the user has the administrator permission, that entry will be marked i=
n red with white text.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from viewing, we also allow some actions per user</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impersonate</strong><br>By clicking this button, you will see R=
AS as if you were the person you are impersonating. After a few hours, you =
will automatically be logged out. If the user you are impersonating was als=
o logged in, he will remain logged in.&nbsp;<br>You can use this function t=
o debug issues.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Permissions<br></strong>By clicking this button, you can change=
 the permissions associated with a user. Be careful, you can create new adm=
inistrators this way.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Send web notification</strong><br>You can send users a notifica=
tion inside of RAS using this functionality. You can pick the urgency level=
, the title and the content for the notification.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Send Reset Password Link</strong><br>A confirmation dialog is s=
hown, which when confirmed will generate a password recovery token and send=
 an email to the user's email address. When the user receives this email, h=
e can click the link contained in it to set a new password for his account.=
&nbsp;<br>You can use this function to help users reset their lost password=
s. For security reasons, user's passwords are not stored in plain text, so =
they can not be shown in plain text.&nbsp;<br><br>When a user requests pass=
word recovery, verify his identity. By sending a reset password link, you a=
re also resetting his two factor authentication, which has security implica=
tions;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h1 id=3D"UserManagement-Creation,throughtokens(registrationflow)">Creation=
, through tokens (registration flow)</h1>
<p>User creation through tokens is the proper way to create a new user. You=
 can go through this workflow by clicking the "Create Registration Token" b=
utton near the top of the user list page. On the following page, you can se=
lect the company with which users will be associated, the permissions the u=
sers will receive and the number of users you want to create (normally 1).&=
nbsp;</p>
<p>By clicking the submit page, you are creating the tokens. You are then s=
hown a page which lists the token links, as well as a mail template for eac=
h created token. If multiple tokens were created, multiple mail forms will =
be shown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either copy the links shown at the top of the page to an email client ou=
tside of RAS, and write the email yourself, or fill out the email forms. Ea=
ch email form has the registration token link prepopulated. You simply need=
 to fill out the recipient's email address, any address you like to put in =
CC or BCC, and make any changes you like to the email body &amp; subject.&n=
bsp;</p>
<p>By clicking the submit button, an email is sent to the addresses specifi=
ed in the form. This email allows the recipient to create a new account, wi=
th the permissions and associated company specified in the first step. The =
user will also be required to validate his email address. Note that the ema=
il address for the account can be different from the one specified in the T=
o: field in the form; users can specify their own email address during regi=
stration.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id=3D"UserManagement-Creation,manually">Creation, manually</h1>
<p>Administrators can manually create new users by clicking the "Add User" =
button. The administrator will be required to specify the user's email addr=
ess (user name), company and password. When clicking the submit button, the=
 user is created and his email address validation vlag is set to True. No e=
mails are sent. Administrators must then&nbsp;<em>manually</em> set the per=
missions for the user. The administrator must also contact the user to let =
him know an account has been created for him, and what his username and pas=
sword is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The manual user creation process is useful mainly when an account needs =
to be "prepared", say for example you want an important customer to have so=
me set of dashboards, reports, filters before the user ever knows he even h=
as an account.&nbsp;</p>
