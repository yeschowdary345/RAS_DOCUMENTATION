    <h1>10.4 Toreon Report Compliance in 2018 Q2</h1>
    <div class=3D"Section1">
        <h1 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-Introduction">Intro=
duction</h1>
<p>This document describes our state of compliance with the recommendations=
 in the 2016 Toreon security report, our path forward and our reasons for d=
oing so.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-Recommendations&amp;State">=
Recommendations &amp; State</h2>
<h3 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-SplittheWebGUIforprivileged=
usersfromcustomeraccess">Split the Web GUI for privileged users from custom=
er access</h3>
<p>Splitting the web UI into a user interface for privileged users and anot=
her for non-privileged users is a possibility. The RAS team agrees that thi=
s could have some positive security impact, but only if we restrict the pri=
vileged interface to LAN only. If we expose the privileged interface to the=
 internet, this is just another attack surface and would actually decrease =
rather than increase security. Limiting this user interface for privileged =
users to the local network would have serious usability consequences. Quick=
ly checking or adjusting some small parameter in the system while an admini=
strator is on the go would be impossible, as a VPN connection would be requ=
ired (which is non-trivial on eg a smartphone).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Splitting the UI into two parts also has a serious development cost asso=
ciated with it. This cost is not (just) a one-time cost, but a cost multipl=
ier that would follow us through the rest of the project. Another user inte=
rface is another thing to break, another project to deploy, another project=
 to maintain, ... We would have to seriously investigate if it is even poss=
ible in ASP.NET to share views etc, or if the administrator interface would=
 be a bare-bones interface that&nbsp;<strong>only</strong> exposes the admi=
nistrative functionalities. Exposing only the administrative functionalitie=
s also has some pretty severe usability consequences for the administrators=
.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combining the privileged and non-privileged interfaces into a single int=
erface is an industry standard that is practiced by most companies. Separat=
ing them, while theoretically more secure has some serious consequences and=
 we should seriously weigh them.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-Implement2FAforprivilegedus=
ers">Implement 2FA for privileged users</h3>
<p>This is not a bad idea and would have made the recent security intrusion=
 a lot more difficult to perform. We've added a new issue to the backlog. <=
span class=3D"confluence-jim-macro jira-issue" data-jira-key=3D"RAS-911"> <=
a href=3D"https://nexchargeapplications.atlassian.net/browse/RAS-911?src=3D=
confmacro" class=3D"jira-issue-key">RAS-911</a> </span> </p>
<h3 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-UserandomGUIDsaslogicaldevi=
ceidentifiersinsteadoftheidentifiermarkedontheoutside">Use random GUIDs as =
logical device identifiers instead of the identifier marked on the outside<=
/h3>
<p>This recommendation has been fully complied with. We have changed the (F=
TP) username to a GUID uniquely identifying the asset that is sending data.=
&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-SetupTLSforMFCconfigconnect=
ion">Setup TLS for MFC config connection</h3>
<p>FTPS (FTP over TLS) has been configured on the side of RAS. Development =
on MFC is still ongoing (out of scope for this analysis).&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-Assurephysicalprotectionand=
tamperdetectionofMFC">Assure physical protection and tamper detection of MF=
C</h3>
<p>This recommendation is aimed at the MFC dev team and is out of scope for=
 this analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-VerifydeviceIDinuploadedfil=
ewithuploadfolder">Verify device ID in uploaded file with upload folder</h3=
>
<p>In our opinion, this does not contribute extra security. The device id (=
eg GUID) is already used as the username. This GUID is not present in filen=
ames and as such cannot be verified. Having the device add it would not hel=
p security, it would be like asking someone the same password twice...&nbsp=
;</p>
<h3 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-ConsiderencryptionforIOtraf=
fic">Consider encryption for IO traffic</h3>
<p>This recommendation is aimed at the MFC dev team and is out of scope for=
 this analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-Usemorepowerfulhardwarewith=
morememorytostoremorecertificates(clientandmultipleservers),moreloggingandf=
astercryptoprocessing">Use more powerful hardware with more memory to store=
&nbsp;more certificates (client and multiple servers), more&nbsp; logging a=
nd faster crypto processing</h3>
<p>This recommendation is aimed at the MFC dev team and is out of scope for=
 this analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-Splitupload/downloadfolders=
andaddfileintegritycheck">Split upload/download folders and add file integr=
ity check</h3>
<p>The transmitting device is currently already allowed to place upload &am=
p; download files in different directories. Regarding the file integrity ch=
eck, this only has meaning if the integrity checksum is calculated on-the-f=
ly while data is being generated. Currently, we've chosen to allow the impo=
rt of possibly corrupt files. Importing these corrupt files may cause data =
quality issues, but does not effect system security.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-Encrypttheexchangedfiles">E=
ncrypt the exchanged files</h3>
<p>We would rather encrypt communication of the files. The MFC is free to e=
ncrypt the file on the SD card and temporarily decrypt before transmission,=
 but discussion of this is out of scope. Encrypting the communication inste=
ad of the files separately allows us to use industry standard protocols and=
 software packages which&nbsp;<strong>increases</strong>&nbsp; rather than =
decreases security.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-High-availablesetupoftheser=
vercomponentswithaDOSprotection">High-available setup of the server compone=
nts with a DOS&nbsp;protection</h3>
<p>Denial of service / high availability etc functionality is rather expens=
ive for a highly custom application like ours. Both the physical hardware, =
the extra development time needed and the operational costs are not to be u=
nderestimated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A DoS resistant / HA setup would be so much more expensive than our curr=
ent production setup that the developers assumed this was not an option at =
the current time.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-SetupseparateTLScertificate=
sforeachservice">Setup separate TLS certificates for each service</h3>
<p>This is not possible with the FTPS protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-Securedandmanagedsetupofthe=
serviceengineerlaptop">Secured and managed setup of the service engineer&nb=
sp;laptop</h3>
<p>This recommendation is aimed at the service department and is out of sco=
pe for this analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-SignMFCfirmwarepackagesandv=
erifythesignaturebeforeupgradingtheMFC">Sign MFC firmware packages and veri=
fy the signature&nbsp;before upgrading the MFC</h3>
<p>This recommendation is aimed at the MFC dev team and is out of scope for=
 this analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-EncryptSDcard">Encrypt SD c=
ard</h3>
<p>This recommendation is aimed at the MFC dev team and is out of scope for=
 this analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id=3D"id-10.4ToreonReportCompliancein2018Q2-VerifyserverSSLcertificateo=
